 * if other Policies specify that authenaticated Agents are *denied* Read access
 * *except* if they're a particular Agent, then that will be left intact.
 * This means that, unless *only* this module's functions are used to manipulate
 * access to this Resource, the set access might not be equal to the effective
 * access for a particular Agent.
 *
 * There are a number of preconditions that have to be fulfilled for this
 * function to work:
 * - Access to the Resource is determined via an Access Control Resource.
 * - The Resource's Access Control Resource does not refer to (Policies or Matchers
 *   in) other Resources.
 * - The current user has access to the Resource's Access Control Resource.
 *
 * If those conditions do not hold, this function will return `null`.
 *
 * Additionally, take note that the given access will only be applied to the
 * given Resource; if that Resource is a Container, access will have to be set
 * for its contained Resources independently.
 *
 * @param resource Resource that was fetched together with its linked Access Control Resource.
 * @param acpData All Access Control Policies and Matchers that apply to a particular Resource.
 * @param access What access (read, append, write, controlRead, controlWrite) to set for authenticated Agents. `true` to allow, `false` to deny, and `undefined` to leave unchanged.
 * @returns The Resource with the updated Access Control Resource attached, if updated successfully, or `null` if not.

 * Set access to a Resource for everybody.
 *
 * This function works with Solid Pods that implement either the Web Access
 * Control spec or the Access Control Policies proposal, with some caveats:
 *
 * - If access to the given Resource has been set using anything other than the
 *   functions in this module, it is possible that it has been set in a way that
 *   prevents this function from reliably setting access, in which case it will
 *   resolve to `null`.
 * - It will only set access explicitly for everybody. In other words,
 *   additional restrictions could be present that further restrict or loosen
 *   what access a user has in particular circumstances.
 * - The provided access will only apply to the given Resource. In other words,
 *   if the Resource is a Container, the configured Access may not apply to
 *   contained Resources.
 * - If the current user does not have permission to view or change access for
 *   the given Resource, this function will resolve to `null`.
 *
 * Additionally, two caveats apply to users with a Pod server that uses WAC:
 * - If the Resource did not have an ACL yet, a new one will be initialised.
 *   This means that changes to the ACL of a parent Container can no longer
 *   affect access people have to this Resource, although existing access will
 *   be preserved.
 * - Setting different values for `controlRead` and `controlWrite` is not
 *   supported, and **will throw an error**. If you expect (some of) your users
 *   to have Pods implementing WAC, be sure to pass the same value for both.
 *
 * @param resourceUrl URL of the Resource you want to change public access to.
 * @param access What access permissions you want to set for everybody to the given Resource. Possible properties are `read`, `append`, `write`, `controlRead` and `controlWrite`: set to `true` to allow, to `false` to stop allowing, or `undefined` to leave unchanged. Take note that `controlRead` and `controlWrite` can not have distinct values for a Pod server implementing Web Access Control; trying this will throw an error.
 * @returns What access has been set for everybody explicitly.

/**
 * :::{admonition} Experimental API
 * :class: important
 *
 * The Access Control Policies proposal has not yet been reviewed for inclusion in the Solid spec.
 * To enable early experimentation, solid-client exposes a low-level API. However, this API can and
 * will include breaking changes in non-major releases. Additionally, for most applications, a
 * higher-level API that is planned will be more applicable.
 *
 * Thus, the following export is *only* intended for experimentation by early adopters, and is not
 * recommended for production applications. Because of this, all ACP-related API's are exported on a
 * single object, which does not facilitate tree-shaking: if you use one ACP-related API, all of
 * them will be included in your bundle.
 *
 * For more information see: [Tutorial: Managing
 * Access](https://docs.inrupt.com/developer-tools/javascript/client-libraries/tutorial/manage-access/)
 * :::
 *
 * This module supports Inrupt's ESS 1.1 ACP implementation.
 *
 * This module can be imported as an object from the main package, which results
 * in tree-shaking not being supported (so all the exported APIs will likely end
 * up in your bundle). This import style is used for environments such as nextjs
 * or create-react-app.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import { acp_ess_1 } from "@inrupt/solid-client";
 * ```
 *
 * @packageDocumentation
 * @module acp_ess_1

 * will include breaking changes in non-major releases. Additionally, for most applications, a
 * higher-level API that is planned will be more applicable.
 *
 * Thus, the following export is *only* intended for experimentation by early adopters, and is not
 * recommended for production applications. Because of this, all ACP-related API's are exported on a
 * single object, which does not facilitate tree-shaking: if you use one ACP-related API, all of
 * them will be included in your bundle.
 *
 * For more information see: [Tutorial: Managing
 * Access](https://docs.inrupt.com/developer-tools/javascript/client-libraries/tutorial/manage-access/)
 * :::
 *
 * This module supports Inrupt's ESS 2.0 ACP implementation.
 *
 * This module can be imported as an object from the main package, which results
 * in tree-shaking not being supported (so all the exported APIs will likely end
 * up in your bundle). This import style is used for environments such as nextjs
 * or create-react-app.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import { acp_ess_2 } from "@inrupt/solid-client";
 * ```
 *
 * @packageDocumentation
 * @module acp_ess_2

 * ```{note} This function is still experimental and subject to change, even in a non-major release.
 * ```
 *
 * Saves a file at a given URL. If a file already exists at the URL,
 * the function overwrites the existing file.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * ```
 * const savedFile = await overwriteFile(
 *   "https://pod.example.com/some/container/myFile.txt",
 *   new Blob(["This is a plain piece of text"], { type: "plain/text" }),
 *   { contentType: "text/plain", fetch: fetch }
 * );
 * ```
 *
 * For additional example, see
 * [Read/Write Files](https://docs.inrupt.com/developer-tools/javascript/client-libraries/tutorial/read-write-files/#write-a-file-to-a-specific-url).
 *
 * *Recommended:* In the `options` parameter, you can specify the
 * [media type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/MIME_type)
 * of the file in the `contentType`.  If unspecified, the function uses the default type of
 * `application/octet-stream`, indicating a binary data file.
 *
 * When saving a file with [[overwriteFile]], the Solid server creates any
 * intermediary Containers as needed; i.e., the Containers do not
 * need to be created in advance. For example, when saving a file to the target URL of
 * https://example.pod/container/resource, if https://example.pod/container/ does not exist,
 * the container is created as part of the save.
 *
 * @param fileUrl The URL where the file is saved.
 * @param file The file to be written.
 * @param options Additional parameters for file creation (e.g., media type).

 * target Resource.
 *
 * As it is still under development, the following export is *only* intended for

 * applications.
 *
 * For more information see: [Tutorial: Managing
 * Access](https://docs.inrupt.com/developer-tools/javascript/client-libraries/tutorial/manage-access/)
 * :::
 *
 * This module can be imported as an object from the main package, which results
 * in tree-shaking not being supported (so all the exported APIs will likely end
 * up in your bundle). This import style is used for environments such as nextjs
 * or create-react-app.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import { universalAccess } from "@inrupt/solid-client";
 * ```
 *
 * Alternatively, if your environment supports [export

 * - If access to the given Resource has been set using anything other than the

 * - It will only set access explicitly for the given Agent. In other words,

 * - The provided access will only apply to the given Resource. In other words,

 *   contained Resources.
 * - If the current user does not have permission to view or change access for
 *   the given Resource, this function will resolve to `null`.
 *
 * Additionally, two caveats apply to users with a Pod server that uses WAC:
 * - If the Resource did not have an ACL yet, a new one will be initialised.
 *   This means that changes to the ACL of a parent Container can no longer
 *   affect access people have to this Resource, although existing access will
 *   be preserved.
 * - Setting different values for `controlRead` and `controlWrite` is not
 *   supported, and **will throw an error**. If you expect (some of) your users
 *   to have Pods implementing WAC, be sure to pass the same value for both.

/**
 * Set access to a resource for the public.
 *
 * This function works with Solid Pods that implement either the Web Access
 * Control spec or the Access Control Policies proposal, with some caveats:
 *
 * - If access to the given Resource has been set using anything other than the
 *   functions in this module, it is possible that it has been set in a way that
 *   prevents this function from reliably setting access.
 * - It will only set access explicitly for the given Agent. In other words,
 *   additional restrictions could be present that further restrict or loosen
 *   what access the given Agent has in particular circumstances.
 * - The provided access will only apply to the given Resource. In other words,
 *   if the Resource is a Container, the configured Access will not apply to
 *   contained Resources.
 * - If the current user does not have permission to view or change access for
 *   the given Resource, this function will resolve to `null`.
 *
 * Additionally, two caveats apply to users with a Pod server that uses WAC:
 * - If the Resource did not have an ACL yet, a new one will be initialised.
 *   This means that changes to the ACL of a parent Container can no longer
 *   affect access people have to this Resource, although existing access will
 *   be preserved.
 * - Setting different values for `controlRead` and `controlWrite` is not
 *   supported, and **will throw an error**. If you expect (some of) your users
 *   to have Pods implementing WAC, be sure to pass the same value for both.
 *

// a transform stream is a readable/writable stream where you do
// something with the data.  Sometimes it's called a "filter",
// but that's not a great name for it, since that implies a thing where
// some bits pass through, and others are simply ignored.  (That would
// be a valid example of a transform, of course.)
//
// While the output is causally related to the input, it's not a
// necessarily symmetric or synchronous transformation.  For example,
// a zlib stream might take multiple plain-text writes(), and then
// emit a single compressed chunk some time in the future.
//
// Here's how this works:
//
// The Transform stream has all the aspects of the readable and writable
// stream classes.  When you write(chunk), that calls _write(chunk,cb)
// internally, and returns false if there's a lot of pending writes
// buffered up.  When you call read(), that calls _read(n) until
// there's enough pending readable data buffered up.
//
// In a transform stream, the written data is placed in a buffer.  When
// _read(n) is called, it transforms the queued up data, calling the
// buffered _write cb's as it consumes chunks.  If consuming a single
// written chunk would result in multiple output chunks, then the first
// outputted bit calls the readcb, and subsequent chunks just go into
// the read buffer, and will cause it to emit 'readable' if necessary.
//
// This way, back-pressure is actually determined by the reading side,
// since _read has to be called to start processing a new chunk.  However,
// a pathological inflate type of transform can cause excessive buffering
// here.  For example, imagine a stream where every byte of input is
// interpreted as an integer from 0-255, and then results in that many
// bytes of output.  Writing the 4 bytes {ff,ff,ff,ff} would result in
// 1kb of data being output.  In this case, you could write a very small
// amount of input, and end up with a very large amount of output.  In
// such a pathological inflating mechanism, there'd be no way to tell
// the system to stop doing the transform.  A single 4MB write could
// cause the system to run out of memory.
//
// However, even in such a pathological case, only a single written chunk
// would be consumed, and then the rest would wait (un-transformed) until
// the results of the previous transformed chunk were consumed.
